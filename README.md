UVA Programming Languages PA5

First of all I apologize because this repo is a mess and will need to be cleaned up. Long story short this is an interpretter for the COOL programming language writting in Haskell.  The functional source is in monadfun.hs (not main.hs I warned you this was a mess) and will interpret the output of the type-checking component that I wrote for an earlier assignment in oCaml.
